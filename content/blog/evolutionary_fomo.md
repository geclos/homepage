Why do we fear missing out?

The most basic theory goes a bit like this: We are social animals. Social
animals experience evolutionary pressure to conform to their peer group. Thus,
when a new group behaviour emerges we experience FOMO because we are
instinctively afraid of being left out of the group.

Of course, this line of reasoning leads to more questions.

## Why do we want to fit in so desperately?
The short answer is because it's good for reproductive selection. Social groups
are essentially status power plays where the individual with more status is the
one that hooks with the best, with the most, or both. Stretch this behaviour
over aeons and you get present-day human behaviour.

Why do we keep feeling pressured to conform to the group after we have
reproduced? Again, because it helps maximise our reproductive chances -- the
more children you have, the better.

Why are reproduction levels generally trending downwards despite everyone
(theoretically) optimizing for reproduction? Because selective pressures makes
us compete for status within peer groups, but modern society has made
reproduction an optionality, no longer a necessary requirement.

I'm also curious why some high status individuals have so few offspring but I have
no good theory other than it's anecdotal behaviour.

## Why is FOMO only expressed with some groups?
When Bill Gates buys a 25 million dollar house I don't feel anything, why is
that? My sense is status power plays are only played with close peer groups, to
the level where reproductive selection makes sense. Bill Gates isn't a close peer
to me, he is more of an abstraction, a god-like figure that might as well be
from another species, and for whom my primate brain is not in close competition
for the approval of the same peer group.

FOMO is the other side of the competition coin: No competition, no FOMO.

## Do women feel the same FOMO than men?
My sense is they don't. In other social species females compete to get males,
whereas males compete to get to the top of the group... in order to get females.
That crucial middle step is the one that makes males compete in more dimensions
than females.

I have the sense some of this also happens in humans, albeit with
all the exceptions and many more nuances that our big brains entail.
