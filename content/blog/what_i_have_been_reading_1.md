In the vein of [Tyler
Cowen's](https://marginalrevolution.com/?s=what+i%27ve+been+reading) or [Arnold
King's](Arnold King's), I'm starting this series of posts that will go over my
best reads from the last two weeks, with short commentary to give you the
highlights. You can also find these articles, and some others, if you follow me
on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/geclos), where I publish the best I read
every day.

This will be a bi-weekly publication, but don't quote me on that.

[Studies on Slack](https://t.co/MVyjspRnMZ?amp=1), a great example of how
abstract principles apply to seemingly unconnected phenomena: from competitive
markets to natural selection, players require some slack to thrive. It
starts slow but it ramps up quickly.

[You Will Not Live To See Your Next
Birthday](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/08/opinion/holocaust-survivor.html?referringSource=articleShare),
short and thrilling throughout, it makes most personal hardships feel like minor
inconveniences.

[Complex Is Not The Same As Complicated](https://t.co/OhcLNLc30x?amp=1),
recovered from my archive. Not your typical comparison of complex vs complicated
but rather a recipe on how to deal with each type of system. In short,
complicated stuff can be completely understood, complex phenomena cannot. Aspire
to understand the former, only to manage the latter.

[Dithering And Open Versus Free](https://t.co/82kciX9WWC?amp=1), the podcast
announcement can be glossed over, the interesting part is about how platforms are
monopolizing content distribution and production, slowly killing off open
distribution platforms and independent creators. See also how Netflix went from
distribution channel to one of the biggest content producers in the world, or
how Amazon trades the value of AMC **every second** and is bidding to buy it.

[When Tailwinds Banish](https://luttig.substack.com/p/when-tailwinds-vanish),
the early age of internet companies is coming to an end and most low-hanging
fruit has been taken. How will the next batch of tech companies make it to grow
at past rates VCs have come to expect? I mostly agree with the author's take.

[AlphaGo - The
Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y&feature=share), great
documentary, more for how it's told than for what it tells. After further
reading, I've come to think the claims about AI are overblown, but whatever you
think you know about AlphaGo, this 1-hour film is well worth your time.

[The Climate Club](https://t.co/zdt65nSyZP?amp=1), past agreements to tackle
climate change have failed. The author proposes another approach to
implement an international agreement that will ensure countries comply with
emission targets. Good if you enjoy game theory.

[Behind the Mask of Corruption](https://t.co/zUHMiyacaJ?amp=1) Jeffrey Epstein
drama through the lenses of cinema and Kubrick's Wide Eyes Shut. It made me
re-watch the movie. As leftish an approach as you can find, but you'll enjoy it
if you are remotely interested in cinema.

[50 Ideas That Changed My Life](https://t.co/NEyspTtAc3?amp=1), a case of an
article that's worth more for what it summarizes rather than for what it brings
of new to the table. You'll know most of these, but it's nevertheless a good
piece to keep in your back pocket and re-read every once in a while.
