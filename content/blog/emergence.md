It's a great realization for how obvious it sounds in hindsight. Such a big part
of our lives depend on these wonderful creations: computers, aeroplanes, cars,
the nuclear reactor, democracy... At first glance, it almost seems obvious
someone *had* to invent them. It's even ingrained in the way we talk about them.
We speak about inventions as single entities, unique events in time. And yet the
reality is these tools emerged out of much simpler, incremental steps.

It very loosely resembles the idea of
[Emergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence), which describes how
complex systems stem out of simpler processes. Think how neurons, mindlessly
firing up in your brain, somehow produce your intricate human behaviour. How
ants and bees can build structurally complicated nests. How life is essentially
a collection of molecules arranged in a very particular order.

There must be symmetries between complex systems in nature and the products of
human creativity.
