There's a saying that stipulates you only need one correct argument to be right. If
you need more it probably means you either are wrong or need to think harder.

This mind frame goes against many debating styles, especially against the [rule of
three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(writing)), which I've come
to despise. It's a laudable defense of conciseness.

However, like most sayings, it is not always true.

Jordan Greenhall
[describes](https://www.arnoldkling.com/blog/complicated-vs-complex/) two
problem types: complicated and complex. Complicated problems are bounded and
ultimately tractable, complex problems are infinite and intractable.

In complex problems, you cannot expect to have a winning argument because there
is none. You will ultimately hit a roadblock that will impede you to formulate a
definitive defense. As such, complex problems beget the most heated debates:
issues of cultural relativism, morality, the law, politics, globalization, human
rights â€” The fact people have died defending some opinions on these topics hints
at their complex nature. No one dies to question the nature of an electron's
spin.

On the other hand, you should look for one single argument to defend your
opinion on a complicated issue. Since complicated problems can be completely
known, there is a set of absolute truths about them. You can argue that
gravity pushes objects apart and therefore we should all be tied to the ground
with ropes, but this is easily refutable; Only one argument is needed to negate
it.

Complicated problems are personally humbling because I'm an engineer and,
counter to what you might think, engineering is a complicated topic, not a
complex one. A 747 might look like a complex machine, but it really is not. Put
enough time and resources, everything can be known about a plane, no matter its
scale.

Of course, the world is messy and humans often operate in a state of
incomplete information. Bound by time constraints, we cannot always know
everything about complicated systems, and this results in wrong decision making
about problems that have one single correct solution.

As an engineer, aim at complete knowledge before aiming at complete convincing.

_Addendum: The counterfactual also applies and is better known: you only need
one correct argument to invalidate a point. It's one principle of the sciences,
where hypotheses are tested against experiments and one single result can prove
a theory wrong._

_Addendum 2: I will dedicate more time on how to tackle complex problems in
future posts. In the meantime, suffice to say you should aim at managing, not
solving, complex outcomes._

_Addendum 3: Effectively, artificial constraints (like Q earning reports) turn
complicated problems into complex ones. It is fun to think about the
cost-benefit calculation of this effect._

_Addendum 4: As an engineer, aim at solving the problem at hand with the information
you can get, but the last sentence was too fun not to write._
