The recent kerkuffle around the [US backing the suspension of Covid vaccine
patents](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/05/us/politics/biden-covid-vaccine-patents.html)
got me thinking about how we've become numb to supply woes.[^1] Capitalism has
become so good at shipping goods worldwide that we cannot conceive a failure of
supply, instead we come up with made up explanations that really aren't true.

It is striking because I'm here to argue most apparent market failures are in
fact due to supply problems. Some examples from recent news:

- The spansih Covid vaccine, [delayed more than a
  year](https://elpais.com/ciencia/2021-01-21/exito-en-22-ratones-la-odisea-de-la-vacuna-espanola-mas-adelantada.html)
  because the research team cannot procure lab animals to do the preliminary
  testing, nor can it find a company that would produce the vaccine at scale. A
  supply problem.
- The recent semiconductor shortage wreaking havoc in many industries from GPUs
  to cars, with some admittedly funny [second-order
  effects](https://www.aarp.org/travel/travel-tips/transportation/info-2021/car-rental-shortage.html).
  A supply problem.
- The housing crisis in densely populated urban areas. A supply problem[^2].

Don't take supply for granted.

  the problem in the case of Covid vaccines, supply is.
