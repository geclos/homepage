A top student of her high school class is approaching graduation, and she must
choose what to do next year. Only she is hunted by feelings of doubt and fear.
She dreads not what is ahead but what she will be leaving behind. 

Every choice is an exercise in restraint, for it requires us to abandon
unexplored possibilities. For this student, the epitome of a successful academic
career, this prospect is simply unbearable.

In some ways, we all feel like her at some point in our lives. For it is to be
human to be discontent with the immediate. We are in nature restless, and
because of it we are anguished, despite leaving in the age of greatest
comforts.

The way we cope with our restlessness always involves the search for the
grander, the struggle for something bigger than ourselves. Throughout history,
this longing has often materialized in violence.

This process seemed to end in 1989, with the fall of the Soviet Union and the
End of History. The individual was put front in center, as the end-all-be-all
of a fulfilling life. 

It was, however, the same Fukuyama who raised the question of what was to be
then of western society, left with no other meaning to life than the hedonic
pursuit of happiness.

Michel de Montaigne tried to warn us, back in the sixteenth century, about the
perils of the restless mind. He advised opposing the natural impulse to wonder
and enjoy life for what it is in the immediatelly present.

> Fear, desire, and hope launch us towards the future, and rob us of the
> sentiment and consideration of what *is*, to amuse us with what will be, even
> when we will be no longer.

Unintendently, Montaigne has become one of the most fervent defenders of
the pursuit of happiness through the embrace of the mundane which, in our
capitalist world, is the embrace of the material.

Alas, as the student that introduced this story, we know Montaigne's way of life is
flawed, for it does not provide an answer to our natural longing for the
transcendental.

It was Pascal first, and Tocqueville later, who pointed at the fundamental
hollowness of Montaigne's theory of human flourishing. Specially powerful is
Tocqueville's description of the ills such approach would instill in the
american man.

> The inhabitant of the United States attaches himself to the goods of this
> world as if he was assured of not dying, and he throws himself into seizing
> those that pass within his reach with so much precipitation that one would
> say that at every instant he is afraid of ceasing to live before enjoying
> them.

Without struggle, we are fundamentally bored, and from our boredom most of our
modern ills emanate. This is not to say progress is not a worthy goal, on the
contrary; It is the luxury of our times to struggle in the search for meaning.
It is, indeed, the unanswered question of our times: what are the
constituents of a good life, in the age of abundance.
