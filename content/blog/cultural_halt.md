[Anthony Mackie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj8JK6c5x3M)  rants about the
movie industry:

> There are no movie stars anymore. Anthony Mackie is not a movie star, the
> Falcon is a movie star. [...] The evolution of the superhero has meant the
> death of the movie star. [...] It used to be you went to see the Stallone
> movie, the Schwarzenegger movie, now you go to see X-Men. [...] We are making
> movies for 16 years olds and China.

Besides the self-deprecating jokes there is a wider trend here. More movies,
books and music are produced than ever before, yet the number of original
scripts/books is in decline.

Disney's catalog is a nostalgia-driven compendium of the kind of franchises
Mackie complains about, plus some remakes. Netflix and HBO are not much better;
A regurgitation of low-cost documentaries, novel-based scripts and one-off
projects [often](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6878306/)
[produced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Irishman) by Hollywood moguls with
deep enough pockets to take the losses. Some of these are very good, don't
take me wrong, they just aren't particularly inventive nor there are enough of
the good ones.

It seems the entertainment industry has optimized for low-cost/high-revenue
projects, leaving aside Weird ideas[^1]. Why is that? Is it because streaming
has reduced margins? Has the internet created a cultural hivemind where people
coalesce around the same fictional universes, all the time?

Much of the same can [be said](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/2020/books) about
books, although with [some
exceptions](https://www.amazon.es/Three-Body-Problem-Cixin-Liu/dp/178497157X/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_es_ES=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=the+three+body+problem&qid=1613922986&sr=8-1).
And there's an argument to be made about music stars [having
suffered](https://www.ft.com/content/77768846-a751-45ec-9a12-20fff27ddefb) the
same fate than movie stars.

The only exception, perhaps ironically, is the video game industry, where the
[indiepocalypse](https://www.polygon.com/2018/9/28/17911372/there-are-too-many-video-games-what-now-indiepocalypse)
has resulted in more original ideas being published than ever before[^2]. All
the biggest publishers have swathes of indie studios dedicated to new projects,
alongisde their annualized
[blockbusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty).

Let's have only original-script movies be eligible to Oscar nominations, please.

[^2]: Even if these ideas are harder to monetize.
