Well, this happened.

The world is on lockdown and me with it, so I figured I might as well try to
bring back an old good habit of mine: writing. This isn't [my first
try](https://gerardclos.me/) at this medium thought I certainly hope it would be
my last, for it would signify a certain modicum of success.

A bit about me: I'm Gerard ðŸ‘‹, I am an engineer, infovore and aspirant
polymath. Nowadays, I build Factorial and rant about computer science,
statistics and economcis [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/geclos).

Expect some good content in the coming weeks spanning Computer Science,
Rationalism and everything in between.

Onward!
