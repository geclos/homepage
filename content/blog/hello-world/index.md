Well, this happened.

The world is on lockdown and me with it, so I figured I might as well try to
bring back an old good habit of mine: writing. This isn't [my first
try](https://gerardclos.me/) at this medium, though I certainly hope it would be
my last, for it would signify a certain modicum of success.

A bit about me: I'm Gerard ðŸ‘‹, I am an engineer, infovore and aspirant polymath.
Nowadays, I build [Factorial](https://factorialhr.com/) and rant about computer
science, statistics, and economics [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/geclos).

Expect some good content in the coming weeks spanning Computer Science,
Rationalism, Literature and everything in between.

This blog is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and hosted with
Zeist's [now](https://github.com/zeit/now).

Onward!
