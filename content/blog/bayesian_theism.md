Say, you put the chance of God existing at 75%. Your number might be higher but
the key is that it can't never be 100% because you [can't prove
non-existence.](https://www.qcc.cuny.edu/socialsciences/ppecorino/phil_of_religion_text/CHAPTER_5_ARGUMENTS_EXPERIENCE/Burden-of-Proof.htm#:~:text=%22Proving%20the%20non%2Dexistence%20of,applicable%20to%20the%20non%2Dexistent.)
So, even if you sit at 99%, the possibility of God's existence cannot be
absolutely refuted. Still, 99% are good odds, certainly enough to live as if the question of God is
of no consequence to you.

Alas, this is the wrong way of looking at it. The existence of God is a [Black
Swan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory): an improbable event of
gargantuan consequences. And, as Taleb would put it, playing the game of
probability in the face of a possibly catastrophic event is irrational. The same
way you wouldn't play [Russian
roulette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_roulette) for a million dollars
– even though you effectively would have an 83.3% chance of becoming rich – you
wouldn't bet an atheist life against an eternity in hell.  This is also
[Pascal's argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_wager).

So, should you believe in God?
