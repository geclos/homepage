Knowledge can be broadly categorized into two types:
[propositional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_knowledge) and
[procedural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_knowledge).

Propositional knowledge is the kind that answers questions about the _why_. It is
fundamental. It talks about the laws of physics, computer algorithms, mathematical
theorems. Procedural knowledge answers questions about the _how_. It is much more
practical. It tells you how to cook a dish, build a car, and shoot a rocket into
space. All procedural knowledge is based — at least in part — on propositional
knowledge. You need to understand thermodynamics to design a combustion
engine.

This distinction can be useful when looking at innovation models. Some
organizations focus on propositional innovation, some focus on procedural. But,
here's the catch, **very few do both**.

This goes against the layman's view of innovation: you invent something and you
build a product out of it. According to my view, you can either invent something
or you can build it, but it's hard to do both.

Some of you would have already realized this looks a whole lot like [The
Innovator's Dilemma](https://amzn.to/3g6rGiY), the hugely influential book that
introduced the concept of disruptive innovation. Let's take a look at the
primary example from the book: the hard-disk drive industry.

This industry was dominated by big players, like IBM, who invested hugely in
propositional innovation: fundamental breakthroughs in technology that allowed
them to build ever-smaller hard drives — that they never sold. It was always
smaller entrant firms who took the technology, build the products, and sold
them. They applied procedural innovation.

Other examples of this phenomenon include the Macintosh, ARPANET, GPS, or
most tech startups' offerings. There is some core procedural innovation in all
of these, but the fundamental science was figured out by others who often saw no
profits from their discoveries.

My favorite application of this distinction is when comparing Google and Amazon.

A way of looking at Google is like an unregulated monopoly whose profits are in
part used to fund unorthodox [side-projects](https://x.company/) with little
marketability. The company is known for its tough hiring process of engineers
with PhDs. Of course, not all of Google's branches engage in this kind of core
research, but it's hardly deniable at least some part of Google does, including
[their
founders](https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/17/4340196/mat-honan-on-google-island).

On the other hand there's Amazon, an unregulated monopoly whose profits are used
to — increase its monopoly? The company's motto is about the customer
experience, how to bring value to the market. Their most successful products are
off-the-shelf technologies distributed in innovative ways. A laudable
enterprise no doubt, but hardly propositional. Even Bezos' most exploratory
[endeavors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Origin) aren't affiliated with
Amazon. To me, Amazon looks like the procedural company par excellence.

_Addendum: Marianna Mazzucato's book [The Entrepreneurial
State](https://marianamazzucato.com/entrepreneurial-state/) explains how public
investment often focuses on propositional research (my words, not hers), whereas
private institutions invest in procedural investigation: go-to-market strategies.
Critics of the book often argue that the latter is as important — if not more — than the
former. It's what drives societies' progress. They are de-facto defending the
prevalence of procedural knowledge over propositional._

_Addendum 2: If you think about the differences between both knowledge types
you'll quickly realize the line between them gets blurry in some cases.
I think it is a useful distinction nevertheless._

_Addendum 3: I know there are plenty of organizations that engage in
propositional and procedural R&D, not need to remind me. However, I would argue
most private propositional research relies on market distortions that provide
huge positive optionality. Big pharma, for example, profits from legally
granted monopolies over their discoveries._
