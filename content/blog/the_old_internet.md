It's a great idea that I wish to firmly oppose. But first, let's defend it.

We live in an age of consolidation. Content is getting centralized in the hands
of a few distribution channels: Youtube, Twitter, Facebook and, to some extent,
Traditional Media. These businesses represent the shrinking window to the
cultural and intellectual zeitgeist.

They are also easier systems to monetize. With fewer lanes to content,
gatekeeping has become the norm via ads or subscription models, and OnlyTweets
simply comes to fill a gap Twitter was sorely missing -- despite [some
hints](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/23/tech/twitter-subscription-earnings/index.html)
to the contrary.

You can argue this consolidation has supposed a massive improvement in terms of
convenience for the internet consumer: few pages to visit, infinite feed of
content, plenty of opportunities to get our daily fix of dopamine. Yet, I cannot
help but feel a certain kind of *sameness*.

The Old Internet used to be a place for the Weird and the Wacky. It ain't
anymore. Traditional media bought the blogosphere, Slack replaced IRC, streaming
platforms debunked P2P. Corporatization of content has come at the expense of
heterogeneity. In the pursuit of our convenience we have sacrificed the natural
opacity of an imperfect discovery system that allowed for the expression of
unorthodox ideas.

We have also lost a certain sense of community that came from the difficulty to
find content. Belonging requires exclusion, a place where everyone can get
access to is not a community the same way a public square is not a community.
Twitter is not a community.

A few places on the internet retain that feeling -- Reddit chief amongst them --
and some are trying to reclaim it ironically via paywalls -- see Telegram or
Clubhouse --, but for the most part we have traded novelty and
community for convenience and universal access.

You might agree with this trade. I, for one, long the days of the Old Internet.
