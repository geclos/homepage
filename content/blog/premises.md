Premises are assertions taken at face value that serve as the bedrock for other
ideas. They are, however, most useful to me as a tool to uncover new
perspectives I wouldn't have considered beforehand.

I'll put two examples from very different domains: politics and science.

First, politics.

Watch [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJcKWtiFzIY) from Peter Thiel
and Mike Pompeo on China; It's very good. As a liberal, you would find some of
their ideas unfathomable: closed borders, trade tariffs, America First. Yet,
it's actually a very sensible position, *as long as you agree with their
premises*.

You see, conservatives look at the world as an essentially hostile environment.
One in which a country must remain in a permanent state of battle to preserve
their national interests over those of other nations. It's very much a zero-sum
view marked by the cold war and, most recently, the advent of China.  Most
importantly, under this premise, stringent nationalism is not only a sensible
position but the inevitable logical conclusion one must reach.

On the other side of the spectrum, liberals tend to see the world as a closed system of
mutual economic interdependence, one which ensures cohesion and cooperation
between nations even if they might have divergent political interests[^1]. Notice
how this premise renders the conservative argument illogical: You cannot defend
trade tariffs in a world where economic interdependence is the key tool to
ensure peace and prosperity.

Crucially, we must realize that the political differences with those that
disagree with us don't lie in the specific policies, but almost always stem from
a fundamentally different view of the world[^2]. Argue with the premise, not the
policy.

Now to the second example, science.

Science provides a *representation* of the universe that is in accordance with
the evidence, but that might not be the actual reality[^3]. In fact, it almost
surely never is. This representation sits on top of some keys assumptions --
read: premises -- that simply happen to match the available data.

Take gravity. In 1687, Newton portrayed a view of the universe based on masses
exerting invisible forces at a distance. The premise, that is: *masses exert
forces at a distance*, was in fact the approximation Newton needed to fit his theory to
the available evidence of the time -- apples falling from trees, planets
orbiting around stars --and so we took it at face value. It wasn't, in any case,
the true fact of the matter.

So much so, that some 200 years later, Einstein provided a completely different
account of the world. Masses, as it happened, didn't apply forces at a distance,
but instead deformed a geometric entity called Spacetime, and the
movement of bodies across it was what we perceived as gravity. The premise was
so different it completely changed what we think gravity is: no longer a force[^4],
instead, the description of deformations over Spacetime[^5].

Thinking on the premises underpinning scientific theories makes you keenly aware
of science's role as an *approximation* to reality, not its ultimate
description.

[^1]: I'm hardly the first one to point out the essentially different worldviews
      of liberals and conservatives. For further reading, I will point you to [this
      book](https://www.amazon.com/Three-Languages-Politics-Talking-Political/dp/1944424466).
[^2]: Can you think about the premises that underpin extreme ideas? Racism,
      xenophobia, homophobia?
[^3]: When discussing matters of reality one can often end up in an
      epistomological nightmare of a discussion. Please refrain your mentions to Kant
      on my twitter feed.
[^4]: You will often hear physicists talk how you are, by virtue of being on
      earth, permanently falling at an accelerating pace of 9.8 m/s2. Such a
      statement is nonsensical under Newton's worldview.
[^5]: Other example of useful premises in science are: the Bohr model of the
      atom, formulas of fluid mechanics, mathematic axioms.
