Reading Ribbonfarm's excellent piece on the [illusion of
legibility](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/),
I couldn't stop thinking about the current times we are living in.

Quickly summarized: legibility is the tendency that bureaucratized institutions
have to fit their view of a messy world into a set of constrains in order to
account for it, for purposes of taxation, application of the law and what not.

As the coronavirus pandemic expands, governments worldwide are taking policy
decisions based on figures of diseased and infected that are known to be
inacurate by large margins. Furthermore, different governments are reporting
very different statistics as being the same (e.g: Until recently, the UK didn't
account for Covid-19-related deaths in care homes), when not directly
mascareding their real numbers as is the case of Iran or China.
