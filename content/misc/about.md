So you made it here, congrats!

I'm Gerard ðŸ‘‹, Software Engineer, infovore, and aspirant polymath.

I've been writing on the internet since circa 2009. This blog is my attempt to
organize and share the best ideas that stem from all my readings.

I'm particularly interested in all-encompassing ideas: short, easy-to-digest
concepts that explain an interesting piece of the universe we live in.

Giving names to phenomena has powerful benefits: it allows you to start
poking, ask questions, figure shit out. Without name-giving, we would be mostly
oblivious to the world around us. It's a weapon against entropy.

So, expect lots of entropy-fighting.

Cheers,
G.
