Welcome to the first newsletter-edition of the **Big Ideas Weekly**!

Every week, I will share my best reads from the internet. Most will be written
that same week, some I will recover from my archive of thousands of articles.

This week includes topics on tech, economics, politics, business theory and
an overarching view of society.

Cheers.

Thoughts on E-commerce [part 1](https://t.co/L4WHA3JGzT?amp=1) and [part
2](https://t.co/MVyjspRnMZ?amp=1). Great business theory, regardless of
whether you are interested in e-commerce. It touches on several aspects: search
engines, internet consumer trends, how to solve dependence on 3rd-party
platforms. Some points can be glossed over, but others are well worth
the lengthy read.

[Not even wrong: ways to predict
tech](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2020/5/16/not-even-wrong),
proposes a framework for critiquing. Focused on tech but can be applied to any
domain. Great quotes throughout. Short and to the point.


[A list of ten ways we are
decadent](https://itsonlychemo.wordpress.com/2020/02/17/a-list-of-ten-simple-ways-we-are-decadent-and-a-speculative-theory-about-why-it-might-not-matter/).
Fun and interesting. I like it even if only to pour cold water over Sillicon
Valley's petulant techno-optimism. The premise rings true to me but, if it does not
to you, at least you'll get plenty of opinions to argue against. In support of
Ross Doutart's latest book [The Decadent
Society](https://www.amazon.com/Decadent-Society-Became-Victims-Success/dp/1476785244),
which I also recommend.

[Bibi Was
Right](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/12/benjamin-netanyahu-predicted-rise-authoritarianism/578374/).
On the rise of the populist theory of history, through the lens of Israel's
prime minister. It could be argued Jerusalem is at the forefront of the populist
_rennaissance_. Important.

[Book Review: Secular
Cycles](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/08/12/book-review-secular-cycles/) an
idea so preposterous it cannot be right, and yet lots of historical evidence
supports it. About patterns in human progress.

[One country, two monetary
systems](http://jpkoning.blogspot.com/2020/05/one-country-two-monetary-systems.html).
Quite self-explanatory. Why would a country issue two currencies? What are the
consequences? Makes you rethink the old question of what really *is* money.
